## Crypto Supply Data Scraper

Token supply data is important to understand the dynamics of issuance and redemption. 

This is a simple python script that scrapes the current supply of a cryptocurrency from coinmarketcap.com and saves it to a csv file. The script is intended to be run as a cron job to keep the supply data up to date.

The package is modified based on the original [cryptoCMD](https://github.com/guptarohit/cryptoCMD).
